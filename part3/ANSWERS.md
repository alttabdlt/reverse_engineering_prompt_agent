# Part 3: Conceptual Understanding & System Proficiency

## Agent Evaluation & Correctness

### How would you measure whether your agent is taking the correct action in response to the prompt?

Our Prompt Detective agent employs a multi-layered evaluation approach:

1. **Semantic Similarity Scoring**: We use Cohere's embedding models to calculate semantic similarity between the original output and the output generated from the reconstructed prompt. This provides a quantitative measure of how well the agent understood the intent.

2. **Structural Pattern Matching**: The agent analyzes structural elements (lists, formatting, code blocks) and validates that the reconstructed prompt would produce similar structural patterns. This is measured through our `structural_match` score.

3. **Constraint Satisfaction Metrics**: We track whether specific constraints mentioned in the hypothesized prompt (e.g., "list of 5 items", "formal tone") are satisfied in the original output. Each satisfied constraint increases the confidence score.

4. **Multi-Pass Validation**: The agent performs up to 5 refinement passes, where each pass validates the previous hypothesis by:
   - Generating output from the hypothesized prompt
   - Comparing it with the original output
   - Identifying missing elements and adjusting the hypothesis

5. **Confidence Calibration**: We compare the agent's predicted confidence with the actual match score to ensure the agent isn't overconfident in its predictions.

### Propose a mechanism to detect conflicting or stale results

To detect conflicting or stale results, I propose the following mechanisms:

1. **Version Tracking System**:
   ```python
   class PromptVersion:
       prompt_hash: str
       timestamp: datetime
       confidence: float
       validation_scores: Dict[str, float]
   ```
   Each analysis result includes a hash of the prompt and timestamp, allowing detection of when the same output produces different results.

2. **Consistency Checker**:
   - Compare new results against historical analyses of similar outputs
   - Flag cases where confidence scores differ by more than 20%
   - Alert when structural patterns are detected differently

3. **Staleness Detection**:
   - Track model version used for each analysis
   - Flag results older than 30 days for re-validation
   - Monitor degradation in validation scores over time

4. **Conflict Resolution Protocol**:
   - When conflicts are detected, trigger a comprehensive re-analysis
   - Use ensemble voting from multiple hypothesis generators
   - Maintain audit logs of all conflicting results for manual review

## Prompt Engineering Proficiency

### How do you design system prompts to guide agent behavior effectively?

Our system prompt design follows these principles:

1. **Clear Role Definition**: The agent is explicitly defined as a "world-class reverse prompt engineering detective" with specific expertise in pattern recognition and linguistic analysis.

2. **Structured Thinking Process**: We guide the agent through a systematic analysis:
   ```
   1. Analyze output characteristics
   2. Identify constraints and patterns
   3. Generate multiple hypotheses
   4. Validate through simulation
   5. Refine based on feedback
   ```

3. **Constraint Specification**: The system prompt includes explicit constraints:
   - Always return structured JSON responses
   - Generate at least 3 hypotheses
   - Include confidence scores with reasoning
   - Identify key elements that must appear in the prompt

4. **Fallback Behavior**: The prompt includes instructions for handling edge cases:
   - When confidence is low, generate more diverse hypotheses
   - For ambiguous outputs, focus on identifying the most likely intent
   - Always provide reasoning even when uncertain

### What constraints, tone, and structure do you enforce, and how do you test them?

**Constraints Enforced:**

1. **Output Format**: Strict Pydantic models ensure consistent JSON structure
2. **Hypothesis Quality**: Minimum of 3 hypotheses with confidence scores
3. **Reasoning Requirements**: Each hypothesis must include detailed reasoning
4. **Token Limits**: Maximum prompt length of 500 tokens to ensure efficiency

**Tone Guidelines:**

1. **Professional**: Analytical and objective language
2. **Confident but Measured**: Express uncertainty when appropriate
3. **Educational**: Explain reasoning in a way that helps users understand

**Structure Enforcement:**

1. **Validation Pipeline**: Each hypothesis goes through pattern analysis → generation → validation
2. **Progressive Refinement**: Up to 5 passes with increasing sophistication
3. **Comprehensive Scoring**: 6-dimensional scoring system (semantic, structural, constraint, style, intent, complexity)

**Testing Methodology:**

1. **Unit Tests** (`test_agent.py`):
   - Verify system prompt is correctly applied
   - Test constraint enforcement
   - Validate output structure

2. **Integration Tests** (`test_api.py`):
   - End-to-end testing with various prompt types
   - Edge case handling (empty outputs, very long outputs)
   - Performance under load

3. **Evaluation Framework** (`evaluation/evaluator.py`):
   - 8 comprehensive test cases covering:
     - Simple instructions
     - Complex multi-constraint prompts
     - Role-based scenarios
     - Technical documentation
     - Creative writing
     - Edge cases
   - Automated scoring with both rule-based and LLM-based evaluation

4. **Continuous Validation**:
   - Each request logs validation scores
   - Monitoring for degradation in performance
   - A/B testing of prompt modifications

The testing ensures that our system prompt effectively guides the agent to produce consistent, high-quality reverse prompt engineering while maintaining appropriate confidence calibration and handling edge cases gracefully.
